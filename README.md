BYI:

***(If you are against any of these things, DNI)***

I am proship/profic. [You can read this if you don't know what that is](https://define-proship.carrd.co/) 

I support xenogenders - neopronouns, as well as otherkin/therians, contradictory labels, fictionkin/factkins.

Ponytown:

I am on Ponytown frequently. I don't move places often.

Typically AFK, either i'm watching a youtube video, playing video games, drawing, or chatting with people on discord.

I have severe social anxiety, as well as paranoia. Please don't expect me to respond to you.

If your a minor, your welcome to chat with me, but i request that you don't friend me.

I will block you for whatever reason. Being annoying or covering me will get you an instant block.
